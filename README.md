# 0.0 The cat is cute. You think so too. Don't you?

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93770e67-3824-45aa-aedb-c1f699ec2187

> [!NOTE]
> You can fetch the cat monitoring video from `/cat` endpoint. I'm being serious.
> Alternatively, https://cdn.apis.rocks/cat%20monitoring.mp4 or just download and host the video yourself.

## 0.1 Why?

You ever used https://api.rimunace.xyz? Yeah that's my API I made for you to access AI models.  
I mean, yeah that project is private. It's so bad I can't look at it. So here's an alternative. I call it... APIS.ROCKS

Out of all names I can choose, I have no idea what's so rock about this. I want the "API.ROCKS" but it's already taken (lol xd).
This stuff came out of nowhere. First Golang and now suddenly this. James, if you are reading this, please don't be mad. I imported
the `*.service.ts` like I cared this project since rimunace v2 using nestjs.

So allow me to tell you what I have made here.

```
- 100% free (or is it)
- 100% open source
- 100% customisable
- 100% no credit card required (maybe this one is a lie)

- AI Endpoints
- Admin Endpoints (Panel is sold seperately)
- Database (Redis, Supabase, etc) # but I only made support for Supabase and Upstash Redis
```

## 1.0 Tech Stack

- [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/) - I swear I didn't use this just because someone shared a video of tech talk about it.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - So fast. I love it. Better than default Node.js (or idk, like, just try it).
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - I just use this for schema validation and specifically because this damn workspace uses typescript.
- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - I had a hard time choosing Pino and this. Please spare me the two brain cells.

~~I'm sorry nest.js and hono, maybe next time~~

## 2.0 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure your environment variables
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

5. If you use supabase, you can run the migration to create the tables:
   ```bash
   bun run migrate
   ```

~~P/S: I did not made this to integrate automatically with other database than Redis (Upstash) and Supabase~~

Oh scrape this idea. Redis can be self-hosted.

## 3.0 Deployment

The application is configured for deployment with [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). Use the included `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml` for deployment.
You might need to change some settings in `fly.toml` to fit your needs.

```bash
fly deploy
```

But really, you don't have to force yourself to use fly.io. You can deploy this anywhere you want.
If you're broke like me and you don't wanna pay a surprise 150$ bill by Zeabur (lesson learnt), get a dedicated server my friend.

(Cry in broke)

## 5.0 License

I hereby give you permission to use this project for your own purposes.
I do not take any responsibility for any damage or loss of data that may occur from using this project.
Wait, don't I have to use proper license?

Yes, I do. But I'm too lazy to choose one. So I'm just gonna use MIT. Get that license here: [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)

## 6.0 Contact

Omg you want to contact me? I'm flattered. Send me a hi at `hi@respire.my`

[ In the future, I might need to redesign this readme properly ]
