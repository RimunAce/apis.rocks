# 0.0 The cat is cute. you think so too. don't you?

You ever used https://api.rimunace.xyz? Yeah that's my API I made for you to access AI models.  
I mean, yeah that project is private. It's so bad I can't look at it. So here's an alternative. I call it... APIS.ROCKS

Out of all names I can choose, I have no idea what's so rock about this. I want the "API.ROCKS" but it's already taken (lol xd).
This stuff came out of nowhere. First Golang and now suddenly this. James, if you are reading this, please don't be mad. I imported
the `*.service.ts` like I cared this project since rimunace v2 using nestjs.

So allow me to tell you what I have made here.

```
- 100% free
- 100% open source
- 100% customisable
- 100% no credit card required

- There is a dedicated /cat endpoint. Enjoy the cuteness of the cat on your peephole.
- There is AI endpoints. I mainly do this so I don't have to switch between different APIs. Just changing the models is enough.
- Oh, yeah, this is supposed to be for my personal use but I thought why not share it. It's not like anyone will use this really.
- And maybe there will be more cool features soon. Idk, why don't you keep updated?
- Don't expect me to make this readable cuz I love the chaos of reading an essay.

## 1.0 Tech Stack

- [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/) - I swear I didn't use this just because someone shared a video of tech talk about it.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - So fast. I love it. Better than default Node.js (or idk, like, just try it).
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - I just use this for schema validation and specifically because this damn workspace uses typescript.
- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - I had a hard time choosing Pino and this. Please spare me the two brain cells.

~~I'm sorry nest.js and hono, maybe next time~~
